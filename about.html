<p>In my free time, I occasionally play (both as player and game master) <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, <a href="http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/adventures-in-middle-earth/">Adventures in Middle-earth</a> or other role playing games. I also enjoy the <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/">Pokémon</a> franchise, the Zelda series, most things made by <a href="http://introversion.co.uk/introversion/">Introversion Software</a>, <a href="https://www.alderacsite.com/smash-up-home/">Smash Up</a>, <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>, and some other games.</p>
<p>After babbling BASIC on my CASIO graph 65, I learned <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. I consider it my main programming language. I am also proficient in Python, Javascript, and Scala. I have also been in contact with Scheme, Haskell and C. Most of my public software contributions are on <a href="http://github.com/raphael-proust/">Github</a> and on <a href="https://gitlab.com/raphael-proust">Gitlab</a>.</p>
<p>I speak French and English. I started learning Chinese and Toki Pona although I am not proficient in either.</p>
