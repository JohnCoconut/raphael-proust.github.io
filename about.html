<h1 class="title">Raphaël Proust</h1>

<p>I speak French and English. I started learning Chinese and Toki Pona although I am not proficient in either.</p>
<p>In my free time, I occasionally play (both as player and game master) <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, <a href="http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/adventures-in-middle-earth/">Adventures in Middle-earth</a> or other role playing games. I also enjoy the <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/">Pokémon</a> franchise, the Zelda series, most things made by <a href="http://introversion.co.uk/introversion/">Introversion Software</a>, and some other games.</p>
<p>After babbling BASIC on my CASIO graph 65, I learned <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. I consider it my main programming language. I am also proficient in Python, Javascript, and Scala. I have also been in contact with Scheme, Haskell and C. Most of my public software contributions are on <a href="http://github.com/raphael-proust/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>I was a Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory</a> of the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> under supervision of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/">Alan Mycroft</a>. <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-908.html">My thesis</a> explored the use of compile-time memory management in the context of system programming: replacing garbage collectors by a compilation pass in order to be friendly to system programmers.</p>
<p>I was a student of <a href="http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/">Magdalene college</a> and was involved in the MCR committee (first as Social officer, then as Secretary, then as President and finally as Consultant).</p>
<p>I was an intern at the <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/">Gallium team</a> at <a href="http://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>, working on intermediate representations for compilers (especially functional ones such as CPS and ANF) under supervision by <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/">Xavier Leroy</a>.</p>
<p>I was an intern at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory</a> of the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>. The internship featured different aspects of the <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> project (notably the use of linear types for efficiency and functional reactive programming for dynamic reconfiguration) and was supervised by <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/">Anil Madhavapeddy</a> and hosted by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/">Jon Crowcroft</a>.</p>
