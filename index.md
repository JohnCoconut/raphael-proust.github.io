Past
----

I was a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Alan Mycroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/).
My thesis explored the use of compile-time memory management in the context of system programming: replacing garbage collectors by a compilation pass in order to be friendly to system programmers.

I was a student of [Magdalene college](http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/) and was involved in the MCR committee (first as social officer, then as secretary, and finally as president).

I was an intern at the [Gallium team](http://gallium.inria.fr/) at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr), working on intermediate representations for compilers (especially functional ones such as CPS and ANF) under supervision by [Xavier Leroy](http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/).

I was a student at the [Ã‰NS Cachan](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/) (more specifically at its Brittany extension) in Computer Science.

I was an intern at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/).
The internship featured different aspects of the [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) project (notably the use of linear types for efficiency and functional reactive programming for dynamic reconfiguration) and was supervised by [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/) and hosted by [Jon Crowcroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/).

I was a student at [Paris 7 Denis Diderot]() University in both Computer Science and Mathematics.
