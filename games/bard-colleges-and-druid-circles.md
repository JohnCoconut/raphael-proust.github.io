title: Bard Colleges and Druid Circles
subtitle: Bard and Druid subclasses for 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons
...

I just published [*Bard Colleges*](http://www.dmsguild.com/product/233071/Bard-Colleges-Bard-Subclasses) and [*Druid Circles*](http://www.dmsguild.com/product/233075/Druid-Circle-Druid-Subclasses), a set of subclasses for Bards and Druids in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons, on the [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://www.dmsguild.com/).
It offers options for Bard and Druid characters:

- the College of Dance,
- the College of the Circus,
- the Circle of Bark and Leaves, and
- the Circle of Holism.

Mechanically, these options try to fill gaps in character creation possibilities.
The College of Dance gives the Bard more martial abilities whilst avoiding to depend on Strength.
To that end, it takes inspiration from Monk abilities – e.g., Charisma based Unarmored Defense.

Bards from the College of the Circus gives a varied skillset.
As they gain more levels, these bards gain abilities that work in larger groups of adventurers and as part of a tightly-knit group.

Druids from the Circle of Bark and Leaves lets druids shapeshift into plants.
These druids also become more plant-like.

There is some htematic overlap between the Circle of Bark and Leaves and the recent [Unearthed Arcana's Circle of Spore](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/three-subclasses).
That overlap is small.

And finally, the Circle of Holism makes well balanced Druids that carry tiny beasts and let moss grow on their armor.
