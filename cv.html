<h2 id="projects-at-cambridge-coding-academy-and-cambridge-spark">Projects at Cambridge Coding Academy and Cambridge Spark</h2>
<p><a href="https://cambridgecoding.com/">Cambridge Coding Academy</a> and <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/">Cambridge Spark</a> are twin companies that provide teaching and training in programming, data analysis, machine learning, etc. The former organises courses for teenagers; the latter for professionals.</p>
<p>I started working for the companies as they were set up. When I finished my PhD, I started full time employment for these companies and worked on the projects listed below. I am still working, remotely, on a per-project basis with both companies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Student evaluation system</strong></p>
<p>I participated in the creation and I am still participating in the maintenance and improvement of a system to automatically evaluate students. I also handle part of the system administration for the machines that run the system. The system analyses submitted code, records complete results for later review by the teachers and gives immediate summarised feedback to the students.</p>
<p>The system involves Gitlab, Python, continuous integration, linting libraries, unit testing, Docker images (both building and running), and Amazon Web Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Course writing</strong></p>
<p>I wrote, reviewed, and edited <a href="http://cambridgecoding.com/summerschool">courses for Cambridge Coding Academy</a>. These courses, aimed at teenagers, cover basic programming, making web pages, building games, programmatically generating music, and creating artificial intelligences.</p>
<p>I wrote, reviewed, and edited <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/training">courses for Cambridge Spark</a>. These courses, aimed at professionals, cover basic programming, data-analysis, and quantitative finance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publication pipeline</strong></p>
<p>I wrote and maintained a publication pipeline for content created by Cambridge Spark. The pipeline let authors submit content, make edits, and compile the files locally. It let reviewers make minor changes and request bigger changes. It automatically compiled the files as they were submitted and let project managers publish them online on demand.</p>
<p>The system used Pandoc, custom LaTeX templates, custom HTML templates, Makefiles, integration tests, and continuous integrations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web development</strong></p>
<p>I contributed to the implementation of the online learning platform of Cambridge Coding Academy. The program was written in Scala and Javascript and managed users through an SQL database. The User Interface included an online editor, and rendered user-edited HTML/Javascript/CSS in the browser.</p>
<p>I contributed to two consecutive versions of the <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/">Cambridge Spark website</a>. The website, coded in Scala, uses the Play and Bootstrap frameworks, an SQL database, and custom Javascript.</p>
<p>I also assisted with the system administration. The website is hosted on Amazon Web Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>
<p>I taught numerous courses for both teenagers (with Cambridge Coding Academy) and professionals (with Cambridge Spark) about several aspects of computer science. I also trained teachers and tutors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects-at-the-university-of-cambridge">Projects at the University of Cambridge</h2>
<p>I completed a PhD at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>PhD</strong></p>
<p>The topic of my PhD is the use of compile-time memory management (to replace execution-time garbage collection) in the context of system programming.</p>
<p>I wrote the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-908.html">dissertation</a> in LaTeX, used <code>mk</code> to drive the compilation into pdf, and managed the source files with Git.</p>
<p>I wrote a prototype in OCaml, used <code>make</code> to drive the compilation as well as the tests and the benchmarks, and managed the source files with Git.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Science Laboratory</strong> (additional work)</p>
<p>I supervised undergraduate students, both in tutoring sessions and for longer projects. I organised <a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/user/show/25917">a series of talks</a> for my research team. I contributed to the early setup of the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-test/">Computer Science Admission Test</a> which is used to evaluate candidates to the University of Cambridge Computer Science undergraduate program.</p>
<p>I was awarded the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/local/wiseman.html">Wiseman Award</a> for these contributions to the Computer Science Laboratory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magdalene College MCR Committee member</strong> (MCR: the body of graduate students)</p>
<p>I was Secretary, President and then IT officer of the <a href="http://mcr.magd.cam.ac.uk/">MCR</a> committee of <a href="https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/">Magdalene College</a>. I organised events for around 100 people, represented students in College matters, and organised committee elections.</p></li>
