title: Raphaël Proust
...

I speak French and English.
I started learning Chinese and Toki Pona although I am not proficient in either.

In my free time, I occasionally play (both as player and game master) [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/), [Adventures in Middle-earth](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/adventures-in-middle-earth/) or other role playing games.
I also enjoy the [Pokémon](http://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise, the Zelda series, most things made by [Introversion Software](http://introversion.co.uk/introversion/), and some other games.

After babbling BASIC on my CASIO graph 65, I learned [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
I consider it my main programming language.
I am also proficient in Python, Javascript, and Scala.
I have also been in contact with Scheme, Haskell and C.
Most of my public software contributions are on [Github](http://github.com/raphael-proust/).

# Occupation

## Present

I am working as a freelance software developer and technical writer.
[My CV](/cv.html) has more information.


## Past

I was working for [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com) and [Cambridge Coding Academy](http://cambridgecoding.com) as a software developer and a course developer.
I wrote software to write, review, edit, publish, and deliver courses; I wrote, reviewed, edited, published, and delivered courses about software.

I was a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Alan Mycroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/).
[My thesis](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-908.html) explored the use of compile-time memory management in the context of system programming: replacing garbage collectors by a compilation pass in order to be friendly to system programmers.

I was a student of [Magdalene college](http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/) and was involved in the MCR committee (first as Social officer, then as Secretary, then as President and finally as Consultant).

I was an intern at the [Gallium team](http://gallium.inria.fr/) at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr), working on intermediate representations for compilers (especially functional ones such as CPS and ANF) under supervision by [Xavier Leroy](http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/).

I was an intern at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) of the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/).
The internship featured different aspects of the [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) project (notably the use of linear types for efficiency and functional reactive programming for dynamic reconfiguration) and was supervised by [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/) and hosted by [Jon Crowcroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/).

I was a student at the [ÉNS Cachan](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/) (more specifically at its Brittany extension) in Computer Science.

I was a student at [Paris 7 Denis Diderot University](https://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) in both Computer Science and Mathematics.

I was a student at [Lycée de Kerichen](http://www.lycee-kerichen.org/) in Classes Préparatoires au Grandes Écoles.
